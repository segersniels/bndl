# bndl

Introducing `bndl` ðŸ“¦, a basic TypeScript transpiling and bundling tool for (primarily backend) monorepos. It uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) under the hood so it benefits from the speed improvements that it brings over `tsc`.

While other bundling tools focus on bundling their dependencies inside the files themselves, `bndl` approaches this in a different, maybe slightly odd way.

Instead of trying to bundle everything together it simply tries to copy the built internal packages to the output directory `node_modules`. This way `node` can resolve these modules from the nearest available `node_modules` without having to rely on symbolic links and everything being in place. This can remove a lot of overhead and debugging because of the more simplistic approach to the problem that others try to solve in a different way.

This of course ties in with the monorepo tool that you use (like [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)) and assumes that all internal packages are built before the consuming application.

In a [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) environment this could look like the following:

1. Have turbo configured to build internal dependencies first `"dependsOn": ["^build"]`
2. Run `turbo run build`
3. Internal shared packages build first as configured
4. Consuming application is built through `bndl` after, and does:
    1. Build through `swc`
    2. Identifies internal used `dependencies` specified in the consuming app's `package.json`
    3. Copies over the built `dist` directories to the consuming app's `dist/node_modules/`.

You end up with a compiled _JavaScript_ project that has access to all of its internal monorepo packages without having to worry about them being in the right place in your eg. Docker image.

## Should you use it?

I would see `bndl` as a last resort if you can't get the more popular (and probably better maintained) tools like `tsup` or `webpack` running in your monorepo.

But, if you don't want to deal with the overhead and want to keep your transition from `tsc` to a bundled setup as simple as possible, `bndl` might be the tool for you.
